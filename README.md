ðŸ“˜ Project Summary

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Email Spam Classification system using Deep Learning.
Using the Spam Mails Dataset from Kaggle, text data is cleaned, tokenized, and converted into padded sequences before being fed into RNN, LSTM, and GRU models. Each model is trained and evaluated to compare performance in identifying spam emails effectively.

Key Steps:

Data acquisition via KaggleHub

Data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, padding)

Model building using RNN, LSTM, and GRU layers

Model evaluation and comparison based on accuracy and loss metrics

Visualization of training results

Technologies Used:

Python Â· TensorFlow Â· Keras Â· Pandas Â· NumPy Â· Matplotlib Â· Seaborn

Dataset:

Spam Mails Dataset â€“ Kaggle

Mentors:

Chirag Jhumkhawala, KARKAVELRAJA J, Pranav
